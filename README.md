# Aergwyn's Pilot Displays
### Disclaimer
It's really early in development and I'm still figuring out many things related to Arma and its systems. Luckily the absolutely amazing documentation allows smooth progress whenever you're missing knowledge. *There might be some sarcasm here.*

### Goal
The goal is to create a set of mods that offer useful functionality to Pilots and/or Copilots. Given that many existing mods lack customizability entirely I hope to provide an alternative that can cover some individual preferences.
### Content
So far this project contains
- ⭕ a HMD for Pilots
- ❌ other QoL
### Requirements
Requirement for the mods are
- Community Based Addons ( [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=450814997) | [Github](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3) ) for the ability to provide settings
### Compatibility
The mods are intended to be compatible with
- anything
### Conflicts
The mods are unfortunately incompatible with
- nothing
- - -
### Inspiration
I eventually wanted to do this after being recommended Kimi's [HMDs MOD](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=312724602) a long time ago as well as the more recent [Project Hatchet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1745501605) (also on [Github](https://github.com/Project-Hatchet/public_h-60)). It was amazing to see the possibilities but at the same time it felt lacking because of insufficient customizability (is that a word?).

The best coming last I especially need to mention [Dslyecxi](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dslyecxi) whose mind-blowing self-made tools in all areas of Arma can be seen throughout his videos. I'd love to get far enough to (re-)make some of the QoL features for pilots if permissible.
